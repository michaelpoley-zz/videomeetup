					<p>The Portland Video Content Creators Meetup is for subject matter experts, videographers, audio pros, motion graphic experts, actors-turned-business owners, video podcasters, writers, etc. - anyone who is interested in turning their ideas, passion and businesses into some kind of video content.</p>

					<p>Do you consider yourself a filmmaker? That's ok, we don't either. We are working on videos that aren't necessarily 90 minute films that we want to publish online. Usually this kind of filmmaking puts us into weird places where we're called on to be the writers/actors/directors, with only google searches to guide us - but no more! The Video Content Creators meetup will allow you to meet a network of craftsmen who are attempting the same insane thing that you are! You will become friends, you will share stories (and possibly equipment), and learn more about what you're doing wrong, because when you are creating any kind of video you are almost certainly doing something wrong.</p>

					<p>We'll meet once a month to share the projects we're working on to get feedback and to present findings about the things that we've learned about being Video Content Creators.</p>
